<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<ul>
    <h3><li>Reading</li></h3>
    <p>My passion for reading and contemplation stems from the belief that books encapsulate human wisdom that withstands the test of time. They serve as the shoulders of giants, allowing me to identify blind spots that may impede my progress or discover valuable insights that I can leverage.</p>

    <h3><li>Documentaries</li></h3>
    <p>Documentaries have become a significant interest of mine. While I found them dull as a child, my perspective has evolved with age. I appreciate the authenticity of real people and real-life stories, often feeling a connection with individuals on the opposite side of the planet or with a substantial age difference. I am particularly drawn to documentaries about the animal kingdom, where I glean wisdom from Mother Nature regarding the food chain, survival of the fittest, and the parallels with human society.</p>
    <h3><li>Sports</li></h3>
    <p>In the realm of sports and exercise, I derive great enjoyment from rock climbing. Beyond the physical benefits, such as strengthening the shoulders, arms, and back, it offers a mentally engaging experience akin to solving a puzzle. Rock climbing proves to be an excellent dual xercise for both physical and mental well-being.</p>
